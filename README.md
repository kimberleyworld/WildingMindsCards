# The Random card selection tool
By Kimberley Dobney: written in P5.js, HTML and CSS. 


This is a card selection tool developed for Hope Mayhew of [WildingMinds](https://www.wildingminds.co.uk/) to facilitate online workshops. The images have been chosen based on key themes in Mayhew's paper and the songs are influenced by Mayhews' carefully curated Spotify playlists. Listen to the songs in the cards [here](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0PNIRyC40DnUfHLUIiSgqO?si=a150f7e981c54c03).
## How To Use:

- Ask the client which card they would like to select and click on the chosen card. 
- Discuss the content and reflect on parts that resonate
- Press the X in the corner of the card to exit

## Data.js
